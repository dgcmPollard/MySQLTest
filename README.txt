# README for MySQLTest git project / repository
# Author: David Pollard (david@pollardsetfilles.com)

This is a simple test project for a first repository in GitHub
MySQL test is a real working python script that tests access
to NumPy, SciPy and a MySQL database

This project is unlikely to be useful to others.
The tests will not work unless the python libraries
NumPy and SciPy are available to the user. 
The MySQL test will not work either unless a specific
MySQL database and db_user with the right credentials
are available to the user.
